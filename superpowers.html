			<h2>Superpowers</h2>
			<p>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure is an action anime where the characters use various supernatural fighting abilities in battle.</p>
			
			<div class="superpowers">
				
				<div class="hamon">
					<h3>Hamon</h3>
					<p>A power where the user uses breathing techniques to channel the sun's energy. It is especially useful in battling vampires like Dio or the Pillar men and their armies of  ampire minions, who die from sunlight. This fighting style requires hand-to-hand combat and users merely use the Hamon to enhance their fighting skills. It requires intense training, seen when Jonathan trains under Zeppeli and when Joseph and Caesar train under Lisa Lisa.<br>  
			
					It is only used for the first two parts (Phantom Blood and Battle Tendencies) before it kinda just disappears and is only referenced three times after that.</p>

				<div class="stands">
				
					<h3>Stands</h3>
					<p>A physical manifestation of a person's "life energy" that can be summoned by the "user". They usually appear as semi-humanoid figures that hover over the user's shoulder and each come with their own unique powers. No two stands are the same. They are used to fight each other (kinda like Pokemon), and some use melee techniques while others have various psychological effects or more spiritual. Any damage done to a stand in battle effects the user.<br>

					Stands remain for the rest of the anime and are named after tarot cards at first then after 70s and 80s music references.</p>
