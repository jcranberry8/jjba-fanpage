			<h2>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part Five: Golden Wind</h2>
			
			<p>Part  5 is arguably the best part of the franchise. It has a compelling storyline with creative character designs and funky stand abilities. And who doesn't want to watch a bunch of gay mafiosos run around Italy fighting even gayer enemy stand users? I will say, it is probably the saddest part, from each character's backstory to their various fates, but still definitely my favorite part. The cast of characters alone should convince you.</p>
			
			<h3>Setting</h3>
			<p>The part takes place all across Italy, starting in Naples where viewers meet Giorno and the gang, and follows them on their mission as they hit up iconic destinations like Sardinia, Rome, Venice, and more.</p>
			
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>Some of the best music from the show can be found in part 5. The two intros, Fighting Gold and Uraginimonono Requiem are absolute bangers, and the accompanying animation fits the heavy mood of the part overall.<br> 
			And, it is in this part where viewers are introduced to what is possibly one of the most recognizable songs in anime pop culture: Il Vento d'Oro, better known as Girono's theme, better known as "the jojo song". Anyone who's on the internet would be able to recognize the iconic piano riff that escalates to the refrain with guitar, violin, saxophone, and dramatic choral vocals that fully embodies the spirit of this bizarre adventure. There are other notable character themes that, while they might not be popular outside of the fanbase, absolutely slap (Bucciarati and Diavolo's themes in particular).<br> 
			And let us not forget the best dance scene in anime history, the "Torture Dance", featuring three of the gang members doing a goofy dance to Canzoni Preferite while their captive sits immobilized, his eyes propped open with fishing hooks and glasses strategically placed to focucs the sunlight on his exposed eyeballs, all on a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
			
			<h3>Characters</h3>
			<p>This part contains a cast of characters with, compared to previous parts, very limited returning characters. Hirose Koichi from part 4 makes a brief appearance in the first few episodes, with an even smaller appearance from Kujo Jotaro from parts 3 and 4, and DIO is referenced, as he is the main character's father, but that is all. Viewers are introduced to a brand new bunch of compelling characters.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Giorno Giovanna (age 15): super op, pretty entitled, he has a dream </li>
				<li>Bruno Bucciarati (age 20): mob boss, lowkey cray-cray, collects stray teenagers with anger issues (and one 21 y/o disgraced ex-cop alcoholic)</li>
				<li>Leone Abbacchio (age 21): aformentioned disgraced ex-cop alcoholic, emo boy, down bad for Bucciarati, hates Giorno </li>
				<li>Pannacotta Fugo (age 17): genius child prodigy, disowned by his rich family, major anger issues, takes stuff a bit too seriously, cynical world view</li>
				<li>Narancia Ghirga (age 17): silly lil guy, prone to sudden outbursts of violence, abandonment issues</li>
				<li>Guido Mista (age 19): also a goofy guy, very superstitious, strong aversion to the number four, loves a good beat down</li>
